# Kanmani-Discord-Bot

The bot issues notifications to the server members that remind them to drink water, stretch, rest their eyes from their screens. Anonymous venting feature implemented for users to rant in a safe manner.
Kanmani also can fetch memes, motivational quotes, coding tips and productivity tips. With Kanmani in your server, there is never a dull moment when you're trying to be productive.

# Technologies Used

Kanmani was implemented using Python . We made use of the discord API. Discord.py allowed us to incorporate the functions we wanted to. We hosted our website on replit and used Uptime Robot to host the bot.
We also made use of the Reddit API to fetch posts from popular subreddits. We randomised the fetching of posts for new posts at every command.
